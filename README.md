The provided Solidity smart contract is called `MyToken`, and it represents a simple cryptocurrency token with features for minting (creating new tokens) and burning (destroying tokens). Here's a brief README file to explain the contract's functionalities:

# MyToken Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract implements a basic cryptocurrency token called "SOLANA" (Token Name) with the abbreviation "SOL" (Token Symbol). It keeps track of the total token supply and maintains balances for various addresses. The contract provides two main functions: minting and burning tokens.

## Public Variables

1. `tokenName`: A public string variable that represents the name of the token, which is "SOLANA" in this case.

2. `tokenSymbol`: A public string variable representing the token's abbreviation, which is "SOL."

3. `totalSupply`: A public uint variable that keeps track of the total supply of tokens. It is initialized to 0 and is updated as tokens are minted or burned.

## Mapping

There's a mapping used to store the token balances of different addresses. The mapping associates Ethereum addresses with their respective token balances:

- `tokenBalances`: This mapping associates addresses (of token holders) with their token balances. It allows you to look up the balance of a specific address.

## Mint Function

The mint function (`mintT`) allows the creation of new tokens. It takes two parameters:

- `_address`: The address to which the newly created tokens will be assigned.
- `_amount`: The number of tokens to be created and added to the specified address's balance.

Minting tokens increases the total supply and adds the specified amount to the balance of the target address.

## Burn Function

The burn function (`burnT`) enables the destruction of tokens. It operates in the opposite manner of the mint function and takes two parameters:

- `_address`: The address from which tokens will be destroyed.
- `_amount`: The number of tokens to be destroyed.

Before burning tokens, the function checks if the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the amount to be burned. If the balance is sufficient, it deducts the specified amount from the total supply and reduces the balance of the specified address accordingly. If the balance is insufficient, it raises an error with the message "Insufficient balance."
